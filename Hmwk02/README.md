*ME70 Instruments and Experiments

## PART I
A manufacturer of TMP36 sensors provides the following graph (below, left) showing typical time responses. The speed appears to increase if the sensor is attached to a smaller copper PCB. Compute the time constant for (a) and estimate how much time is required for the TMP36 to reach a static approximation. Use Matlab to generate simulated time responses using your estimated time constants. Compare your reseults to curves a, b, and c.

## PART II
Using labVIEW, make a program that will load position data (one position per row in a text file) and display an n-point moving average of the velocity. Use the text file sim_decayingoscillation as position data.
