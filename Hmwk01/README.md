*ME70 Intruments and Experiments*

## PART I
A TMP36 temperature sensor provides the following readings for boiling water (in degrees celsius): [98.1; 101.2, 99.5, 100.1, 100.3, 99.4, 98.9]. Estimate the systematic error, maximum random error, and average magnitude (typical) of random error. Explain the differences in why it might be useful to know A, B, and C.

## PART II
Using labview, make a for-loop to concatenate an input array to make an output array.
Input Array:
|3|;
|4|
Output Array:
|3|
|4|
|3|
|4|

Using labview, make a nested for-loop that outputs a nxm array, with each entry showing a number encoding the row and column. Here is an example:
|11|12|13|
|21|22|23|
