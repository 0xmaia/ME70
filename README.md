# ME70
MATLAB and LabVIEW code for ME70 Instruments and Experiments

In this repository there are completed Matlab and LabVIEW assignments for ME70. The goal of the course is to develop skills in conduction experiment-driven research from a mechanical engineering perspective. Some of the key learning objectives include the use of live data visualization, uncertainty analysis, and data reduction and analysis which can be accomplished with the use of MATLAB and NI LabVIEW. Throughout the course the assignments become more challenging to test our understanding of material.
