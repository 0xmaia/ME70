## PART I
The table belows shows mass measurments for three kinds of fruit taken across five days. Make a boxplot comparing the means of each group of fruit. Determine whether there is a significant difference between measurements for fruit category. Next, ignoring the fruit category entirely, perform a linear regression using day as the XDATA and mass as YDATA. Report the R-square and p-value. Finally, make a combined plot of the raw data and the linear model ymodel = m*xdata + B to show how the mass changes as a function of the day.

## PART II
Write labVIEW code that will detect a oeaj event in a data stream, and then generate a waveform chart of the data n-points before and n-points after the peak event. Such a peak event is simply to specify time in which your data exhibits a local maximum above a certain baseline floor level. Make your code allow user input to set a threshold for how low of a signal still counts as a peak event. Use the SimPulseSignal text file for your input. This file presents a data stream with a few sharp peaks in data with smaller amplitude "noise". You will have to decide what is an appropriate threshold level for peak detection.
