# Homework 7
*ME70 Instruments and Experiments*

## PART I
For this problem, your goal is to collect some cursor motion in Matlab and then compute ideal normal distributions to fit the resulting data. In the code, determine the histograms and one-dimensional models, compute the probabilities for the two-dimensional model according to the equations below. Collect data for small, rapid mouse movements for two conditions: 1) circular, and 2) random patterns. Provide figures of your results and comment on how well the models fit your data.

## PART II
Make LabVIEW code that will generate a 2D histogram scaled in the correct units. Using sample X and Y data, compute the 2D grid of histogram counts Z from 2D arrays for grids of X and Y data that are scaled to the correct units. Make a final 3D surf mesh of the X, Y, and Z data.
