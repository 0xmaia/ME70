Evaluate the coefficient of determination for recovering position data from acceleration data. Build sub-vi's for numerical integration and a working R-squared calculation. Consider the ideal model as the original position data, while imperfect actual data comes from the ouput of the double integrated signal the virtual accelerometer. Make a table of R-squared versus damping values as shown below. Leave the default values for m = 0.001 kg, and k = 2000 N/m.
